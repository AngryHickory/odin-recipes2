    <h2>Stacey's Hamburger Seasoning</h2>
    <p>This burger seasoning is what I use to season my hamburger patties before cooking them. It gives them a wonderful gourmet flavor that makes a so-so hamburger extraordinary. Season your burgers just before grilling or sprinkle over top while pan-frying. Store in an airtight container in a cool, dry place.</p>
    <div></div>
    <p>It's time to stop putting plain, unseasoned burgers on the grill. Instead, season your patties with this delicious (and ridiculously easy) burger seasoning.</p>
    <p>With just a handful of spices and seasonings, this burger seasoning will become a pantry staple to save all your future hamburgers from boring flavors.</p>
    <h2>What Do You Season Burgers With?</h2>
    <p>This recipe has a mixture of savory, sweet, and spicy ingredients. It's made with paprika, salt, pepper, brown sugar, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper.</p>
    <h2>How to Make Burger Seasoning</h2>
    <p>Making homemade burger seasoning is so easy that you could create a whole batch in less than five minutes.</p>
    <p>Simply place all the ingredients in an airtight container, seal, and shake to combine. You could also add all ingredients to a bowl, mix, and then transfer to an airtight container.</p>
    <h2>How to Season Burgers</h2>
    <p>When you're ready to use your burger seasoning, simply sprinkle as much or as little seasoning as you like on both sides of the patty. Measure with your heart!</p>
    <p>Make sure the hamburgers are defrosted so the seasoning will stick to the patty.</p>
    <h2>How to Store Burger Seasoning</h2>
    <p>Store seasoning in an airtight container in a cool, dry, and dark place (like a pantry). It should remain fresh for six months.</p>
    <h2>Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise</h2>
    <p>"My whole family loves this seasoning blend. My kids actually request it on their hamburgers! A definite win," according to Kristicus.</p>
    <p>"This adds such a great, and versatile, flavor. Aside from halving the salt, I follow it as written and it's wonderful on burgers (beef, turkey, even soy patties), chicken, and pork. This is now my go-to seasoning," says Jessica.</p>
    <p>"This seasoning is great! I didn't just use it in my hamburger (which was why I made a batch of it in the first place) but I added it to all sorts of things I was cooking: meatloaf, stew, even in vegetables such as corn! My husband raved about the corn! I DID just add a pinch of cayenne instead of 1/4 tsp since my daughter does not like anything spicy, and she liked this as well," raves Lisa Ingram.</p>
