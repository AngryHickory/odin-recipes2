  <p>Once you try this homemade Alfredo sauce recipe, you’ll never go back to the jarred stuff. </p>
  <h2>How to Make Alfredo Sauce</h2>
  <p>You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>
  <h3>Alfredo Sauce Ingredients</h3>
  <p>You’ll need just five simple ingredients to make this basic Alfredo sauce recipe: butter, heavy cream, Parmesan cheese, garlic, and fresh parsley. </p>
  <h3>How to Make Homemade Alfredo Sauce</h3>
  <p>Here’s a brief overview of what you can expect when you make Alfredo sauce from scratch: </p>
  <ol>
    <li> Melt the butter, then stir in the cream and simmer. </li>
    <li> Whisk in the cheese and garlic until heated through and smooth. </li>
    <li> Stir in the parsley. </li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Tip from recipe creator Rebecca Swift:</strong> “I have found that Parmesan cheese doesn't always melt well, and often substitute Gruyère cheese.”</p>
  <h3>How to Thicken Alfredo Sauce</h3>
  <p>This Alfredo sauce should be thick enough as-is. However, if you’d like to thicken it up even more, add more Parmesan than the recipe calls for. Continue whisking in cheese until the sauce has reached the desired consistency.</p>
  <h2>How to Serve Alfredo Sauce</h2>
  <p>Toss the homemade Alfredo sauce with fettuccine for a classic comfort food dinner or spread it over pizza dough for a fun twist on traditional pizza.</p>
  <h2>How to Store Alfredo Sauce</h2>
  <p>Allow the leftover Alfredo sauce to cool completely, then transfer it to an airtight container. Store it in the refrigerator for up to five days. </p>
  <h2>Can You Freeze Alfredo Sauce?</h2>
  <p>Sure! You can freeze Alfredo sauce if you’d like to keep it for more than five days. Portion it out into freezer-safe bags or containers, then freeze for up to three months. Thaw the Alfredo sauce in the refrigerator overnight. </p>
